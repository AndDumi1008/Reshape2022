## What problem do we solve
People fail to organize themselves and follow a program made for them, either because of a lack of motivation or because they don't know or don't realize the importance of organizing their own program.

&emsp;

## How we solve
We give our users the chance to *copy* (and *adapt*) the behaviour and program of some of the **world's outstanding personalities* of the last 200 years. We give them the daily schedule of each celebrity, and they are free to choose what they want to do or not. Showing them daily how close they are to become their role models in life.

&emsp;

## Scientific study
Because our *idea solves an existing problem in modern life*, <mark>we rely only on numbers when making decisions<mark>, so we conducted this study before doing this project.

People want to be just like their favorite celebrities because they see them as leaders and want to do what leaders are doing or have what they have. As humans, we believe in social proof and emulation. We want to mimic their behavior because it makes us feel like part of something bigger than ourselves. That's why so many people aspire to things like executive positions or careers as doctors. Everyone needs leadership in their lives

### Guidance

One of the largest reasons why people follow commanders is because they need counsel. People go through different experiences in their lives and don't always know what they should do.

### Expertise
People also want to be led because they don't know as much as leaders do. If someone works at a company, they may not have all the information that their boss does.

By following them, individuals increase their knowledge base and become more capable employees or workers in general. By following their figurehead, they can get an edge over others at work or school.

### A sense of purpose

Sometimes, followers want to be led because they don't know what they're fighting for. Rulers help them establish a cause and make them believe in it with passion and conviction.

A leader‚Äôs vision can inspire followers to work toward a common goal or dream. They will do what they're told and more to help the cause along.

People want to follow someone who knows what they're doing and can get the job done. They would rather have a person who is extremely knowledgeable about their company or industry in charge rather than an individual who is weak or unsure of what to do.

The reasons people follow leaders are largely governed by their desire to have someone who will help make the best choices for them, give them what they need, and attain a sense of purpose. If commanders work to strengthen their abilities and show that they can get the job done, it'll increase the likelihood of others following suit.
